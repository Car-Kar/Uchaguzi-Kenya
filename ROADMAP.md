## Roadmap

***Foster social and political empowerment through digital literacy.***

Uchaguzi Kenya currently provides information about the 2017 Kenyan General Election with a focus on the candidates that were vying
then.  
This roadmap details milestones/goals to expand the functionality and community around the project.

### Short Term Milestones
- [ ] **New name.**  
  The Uchaguzi Kenya name is suitable for the current iteration of the project which deals solely in elections. As the functionality of the project increases, a new name should be considered.
- [ ] **Project expansion.**  
Decide on what functionality should be added to the project and the timelines. This should be divided into short and long term goals.
- [ ] **Gather and analyze feedback from previous users.**  
Get in touch with the active users from the initial run of the project and collate their feedback into actionable items.

### Medium Term Milestones.
