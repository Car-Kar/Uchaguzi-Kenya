				With well over 4.1 billion internet users all over the world, Africa has had the highest growth rate in terms of penetration and increase in number of users. Kenya in particular has the 5th highest internet penetration in Africa at 45% with Google reporting 13 million active internet users. Most of the time spent on the internet is attributed to social Media sites with a staggering 8.2 million users. Kenya users will spend close to 3 hours per day on social media. Facebook claims the largest market share of all the social media platforms at 65% with 7.1 million active users in Kenya alone.
				<br />
				<br/>
				Considering all these statistics, it is evident that if used appropriately as they has been used in other countries and other sectors ,social media platforms can be very effective tools of social empowerment.

				What Jumuiya is proposing based on the web literacy skills of reading and participating on the Web is an interactive bot aimed at tapping the social mediaâ€™s (specifically Facebook) unused potential to ,Engage the constituents of the community ,Inform them on issues relevant to them such as unbiased political reports and Empower them with knowledge.
				The Jumuiya initiative will use Facebook Messenger as tool for social empowerment by availing useful information to the community of people who use Facebook. The content provided will touch on the relevant political environment of the country, socio-economic opportunities and projects, technological advancements that benefit the community.
				A community is based on the ideology of sharing, thus Jumuiya will also allow users to share relevant, informative and considerate articles with us. By pooling our informative resources together, we as a community get access to an unprecedented experience of using this powerful tool, which up to date has been used in other detrimental ways to our society, to embolden ourselves and those around us so as to advance further, together.
